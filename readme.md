# LifeGame
## ~~blabla~~ intro
I met some difficulties in my life so i decide to code something.  
Life does not go well, and i'm going to code a life game, how ironic.  
The core code comes from [this post](https://beltoforion.de/en/recreational_mathematics/game_of_life.php)

## functional needs
I developped an ascii style lifegame earlier... however running python in a terminal is not performant. The program is not as smooth as the famous C donut.  
So i decided to use the python game library.
- the canva size is not fixed
- user can draw the initial state in paint, then save in jpg/png, then the program read it.
- bonus feature: user can add blocks in real time, after the game launched


## task lsit
- ~~define py version~~
- ~~create virtual env~~
- ~~install libs~~
- learn lifegame.py
- clean up code
- add feature
